# Nibbles

![nibble_banner](/assets/images/nibbles/nibble_banner.png)

With the goal of taking the OSCP exam next year, I started my journey of pentesting machines from HackTheBox using the [TJNull's TryHarder machine list](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html#vulnerable-machines).

[Nibbles](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Nibbles) is  is the first in a long series of boxes I will be doing here.
It is an easy retired linux machine that should not be too hard to start with, so without further ado, let's hack it.

## Reconnaissance

The first thing to do is a TCP port scan on all ports.

```txt
sudo nmap -sS -sV -p- 10.129.182.190 -oA scan/nibbles_nmap -vv

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

Two ports are open, the most interesting one is the web server as we cannot do much with SSH without credentials.

### HTTP - Port 80

Land on a page with the message *Hello World* displayed. Looking at source code, we find a comment with a path to `/nibbleblog`. This is the path to a Nibbleblog CMS.

Trying bruteforce directory enumeration with `gobuster`, there is a lot of path available to us to search in.

```txt

```

Pretty much everything is available, we can get the Apache version written at the bottom of index page `Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) Server`

We find the CMS version in the `/README` file.

```txt
====== Nibbleblog ======
Version: v4.0.3
Codename: Coffee
Release date: 2014-04-01
```

`/admin.php` is a login page to an administration interface.

We can enumerate user in `/content/private/users.xml`, the only user is `admin`
```xml
<users>
    <user username="admin">
        <id type="integer">0</id>
        <session_fail_count type="integer">0</session_fail_count>
        <session_date type="integer">1514544131</session_date>
    </user>
    <blacklist type="string" ip="10.10.10.1">
        <date type="integer">1512964659</date>
        <fail_count type="integer">1</fail_count>
    </blacklist>
    <blacklist type="string" ip="10.10.14.80">
        <date type="integer">1639688608</date>
        <fail_count type="integer">1</fail_count>
    </blacklist>
</users>
```

Trying bruteforcing the login form with `Hydra`, we hit a bruteforce protection, my HTB IP has been banned. :(
After waiting a few minutes, it's working again, so we can't really bruteforce, we need to do some manual guessing to find the password.

After searching on the Nibbleblog documentation and in the github repository, can't seem to find anything close to a default credentials.

With a complete random guess, the credentials was `admin:nibbles`.

## Initial Foothold

Looking for exploits for `Nibbleblog 4.0.3`, we find a very interesting feature. If the plugin `MyImage` is installed, we could be able to upload any file without any restriction, the plugin only giving us warnings but no errors and we are lucky because the plugin is indeed, installed.

![nibble_plugin](/assets/images/nibbles/nibble_plugin.png)

Let's try it first with a legitimate image to find the destination directory. After uploading my favorite image (a little tux pinguin), it appears on the main page !

The image is in `/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/`

![nibble_img_location](/assets/images/nibbles/nibble_image_location.png)

And it looks like it has been converted from `.png` to `.jpg`. Now that we know where the image is located, let's upload something more evil, a reverse shell ðŸ˜ˆ

As the webserver understands PHP, let's find a reverse shell made in this programming language.\
One is avaible here on [pentestmonkey's github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php).

We upload the malicious file, ignore the warning, and find our file in the directory and boom.

![nibble_foothold](/assets/images/nibbles/nibble_foothold.png)

We have our initial access on the machine !

## Privilege Escalation

Our shell is not very sexy, we can upgrade it using the python3 method

```txt
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' 
then Ctrl-Z 
stty raw -echo;fg
export TERM=xterm
```

Now we have a fully interactive TTY, much better.

```txt
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for nibbler on Nibbles:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User nibbler may run the following commands on Nibbles:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```

The user `nibbler` is able to run a custom script as the `root` user in a path the user has the control on.

There is a `peronal.zip` file in the user home directory, extracting it reveals the `monitor.sh` file we are looking for.

```txt
ls -lah /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh 
-rwxrwxrwx 1 nibbler nibbler 4.0K May  8  2015 /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```

Do you see the vulnerability here ? Because we have full control over the file, we can write absolutely whatever we want inside of it as long as it keeps the same path and filename.

We can modify the file and give ourselves another reverse shell, the script running as the `root` user, it is the `root` user that will initiate the connection to our machine.

![nibble_root](/assets/images/nibbles/nibble_root.png)

And voila, we have now rooted the box !

## Conclusion

The box was pretty easy, the password guessing part was not the most fun and intuitive but overall the box was great.

Hope you enjoy reading it through. :)
